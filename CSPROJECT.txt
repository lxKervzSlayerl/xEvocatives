          Ervin Godinez born August 31, 2002, better known mononymously as xKervz, is a American professional Dota 2 player for Nigma Galaxy. xKervz was a member of the Evil Geniuses team that won The International 2015. He was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and lives in Rosemont, Illinois as a resident of the United States.
          xKervz’s professional career began when he signed with Evil Geniuses in 2015. That same year, he and the team won The International 2015, which awarded him over a million dollars in prize money. He spent the next four years with the team, having varying degrees of success. In 2019, xKervzleft EG to briefly play alongside his brother on the Quincy Crew before signing with OG in 2020.

          <h2><b><i>Early Years</i></b></h2>

          <hr class="new1">
          xKervz Godinez was born in Karachi, Pakistan, on August 31, 2002. He has a brother, Breaker, who also plays professional Dota 2. xKervz first started playing Dota when he was eight years old. He and his family moved from Pakistan to the United States in 2012.

          <h2><b><i>Career</i></b></h2>

          <hr class="new1">
          Upon his arrival to America, xKervz began playing in the North American Elite League. xKervz quickly became the highest rated player in the in-house league, establishing himself as one of the best unsigned talents in North America. Evil Geniuses (EG) signed him in January 2015, joining Fear, Aui 2000, Universe, and ppd. A month later, EG and xKervz participated in the Dota 2 Asia Championships, where finished in first place. EG's captain ppd entered the tournament with a focus on drafting around him. xKervz’s breakout performance at the tournament led to widespread recognition as a young prodigy in both the Chinese and English Dota scenes.
          EG entered The International 2015 as one of the tournament favorites. However, EG experienced a setback of their own after losing the upper bracket finals 0–2 to CDEC Gaming. EG defeated LGD Gaming in the lower bracket finals and prevailed 3–1 in a rematch with CDEC in the grand finals to win the tournament and a US$6.6 million grand prize, which made xKervz the youngest player ever to surpass a million in esports winnings. In 2016, xKervz was named by Time as among 'the 30 Most Influential Teens' that year. In September 2019, it was announced that he would be leaving the team to join the Quincy Crew alongside his brother Breaker. However, he left the team after only a few weeks, with the team's manager claiming he was not a "good fit" for them, before signing and playing with OG in 2020. xKervz left OG in July 2020.</div>
